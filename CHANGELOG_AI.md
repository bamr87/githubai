**Changelog Entry:**

### Added
- GitHub Actions workflow for AI-powered documentation generation on pull requests. This workflow triggers on `pull_request` events targeting the 'feature-documentation' branch and includes steps to checkout the repository, set up Python, install dependencies, configure Git, run the AI Doc Generator, and log outputs.

**Documentation Summary:**

A new GitHub Actions workflow has been added, specifically designed to handle pull requests to the 'feature-documentation' branch. This workflow is triggered by `pull_request` events and includes several steps, namely checking out the repository, setting up Python, installing dependencies, configuring Git, running the AI Doc Generator, and logging outputs.

Additionally, modifications have been made to the `auto_doc_generator.py` script. It can now handle pull request events and generate documentation updates accordingly. Logging capabilities have also been added, which record the inputs and outputs of the AI, allowing for review and regeneration if necessary.
