# Test Script Template

**1. Test Plan Overview**

**Purpose/Objective**
Explain why the test plan is being created and what overall goals it aims to achieve (e.g., verifying critical functionality, identifying edge cases, ensuring performance meets expectations).

**Scope**
Describe the scope of the testing. Clearly outline the features, modules, or functionalities that are included, as well as any areas specifically out of scope.

---

**2. References**
List any relevant documentation, requirements, or design specifications that will help clarify the features under test (e.g., project requirements, design diagrams, user stories, acceptance criteria).

---

**3. Test Environment**

**Hardware/Software Requirements**
- Detail the operating system(s), browsers, devices, or hardware specifications.
- Include any additional libraries, frameworks, or dependencies needed.

**Configuration Instructions**
- Include step-by-step notes on how to set up or configure the environment before running the tests (e.g., necessary services, environment variables, database seeds).

---

**4. Prerequisites and Assumptions**

**Prerequisites**
- List conditions that must be met before testing begins (e.g., certain data loaded, user permissions granted).

**Assumptions**
- Outline any assumptions you are making that might affect the testing (e.g., stable network connectivity, specific user roles exist).

---

**5. Test Data**
Provide details about any mock or real data needed to execute the tests. If there are multiple data sets, specify each one's purpose and expected outcomes.

---

**6. Testing Approach**

**Types of Testing**
- **Functional**: What specific functional areas or use cases will you test?
- **Integration**: Which components or services will be tested together?
- **Regression**: How will you ensure that previously working features remain functional?
- **Performance/Load** (if applicable): How will you check performance under heavy load or stress conditions?
- **Security** (if applicable): Include basic security checks or vulnerability scans if required.

**Test Execution Strategy**
- Describe how tests will be run (manually, automated, or a mix).
- Detail the tools or frameworks used (e.g., Selenium, Jest, Cypress, PyTest).

---

**7. Detailed Test Cases**
Outline each test case in a structured format. Below is an example table or list you might use:

| **Test Case ID** | **Test Case Title**                 | **Description**                                     | **Preconditions**                | **Steps**                                                                                                                                     | **Expected Result**                                                |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TC-01            | [High-level title of the test case] | A brief description of what this test aims to do.  | List any conditions needed.      | 1. Step one for executing the test. <br> 2. Step two. <br> 3. Step three.                               | Describe the outcome if the test passes.                           |
| TC-02            |                                     |                                                     |                                  |                                                                                                                                               |                                                                    |

Use as many rows as needed to cover all scenarios and edge cases.

---

**8. Pass/Fail Criteria**
Define the criteria that determines whether each test (or the overall test plan) has passed or failed. This often includes:

- The percentage of test cases passed.
- Zero critical defects related to specific functionalities.
- Acceptable performance metrics or error rates.

---

**9. Potential Risks and Mitigations**
Identify risks that could hinder testing or compromise results, and how you plan to mitigate them (e.g., incomplete requirements, hardware constraints, limited test data, or resource availability).

---

**10. Reporting and Documentation**
Explain how and where test results will be recorded:

- **Test Execution Logs**: Where to log test results (e.g., in a test management tool, CI/CD pipeline logs, or a shared document).
- **Defect Reporting**: The process for logging defects (e.g., using GitHub issues, Jira, or another bug-tracking system).
- **Metrics/Reports**: If specific metrics (like coverage or pass/fail statistics) will be generated, describe how they will be compiled and shared.

---

**11. Approval and Sign-Off**
Identify key stakeholders who need to review and sign off on the plan and test results. Include names, roles, and confirmation checkpoints.

---

**12. Revision History**

| **Version** | **Date**   | **Author**  | **Changes**               |
|-------------|------------|------------|---------------------------|
| 0.1         | YYYY-MM-DD | Your Name   | Initial draft            |
| 0.2         | YYYY-MM-DD | Reviewer    | Updated after review     |

---

**13. Conclusion**
Summarize the expected outcomes and reaffirm the scope, approach, and success criteria. Provide a final statement on what successful completion of this plan/script will accomplish for the project or product.

---

**Usage**
