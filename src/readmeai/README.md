# 📖 ReadmeAI

**Intelligently Automate and Enhance Your README Files Using AI**

---

## 🌟 Overview

ReadmeAI is a powerful Python-based application that leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 to automate and intelligently enhance the README files in your GitHub repositories. With seamless integration through GitHub Actions, ReadmeAI automatically generates structured, detailed README updates by referencing repository files and user-provided information.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **AI-Driven README Updates:** Automatically generate and structure content for README.md files using GPT-4.
- **Dynamic Contextualization:** Incorporate content from multiple repository files (e.g., Python files, existing READMEs) as context for AI-generated updates.
- **GitHub Integration:** Fully integrated with GitHub Actions for automated workflows.
- **Template Customization:** Easily define and customize YAML-driven templates for consistent README updates.

## ⚙️ How it Works

1. **Issue Creation:** Users open a simple issue requesting README updates via GitHub.
2. **Automated Trigger:** GitHub Actions immediately triggers upon issue creation.
3. **Contextual Gathering:** ReadmeAI retrieves content from specified files in the repository.
4. **AI Processing:** The AI (GPT-4) processes the issue description along with file contents to generate structured README updates.
5. **Automated Issue Creation:** A detailed, structured issue with the recommended README changes is automatically created and linked to the initial request.
